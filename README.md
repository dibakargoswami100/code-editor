ðŸš€ New Project Alert: Creating a Code Editor with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! ðŸš€

I'm excited to share my latest project where I've built a simple and functional code editor using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This editor allows users to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and see the output in real-time. It's a great tool for both beginners and experienced developers to experiment with code directly in the browser.

Key Features:
ðŸ’» Real-time code execution
ðŸŽ¨ Simple and clean user interface
ðŸ“± Responsive design for all devices

Project Overview:
In this project, I've set up the basic HTML structure, styled the editor with CSS, and added JavaScript to handle the real-time rendering of code.
